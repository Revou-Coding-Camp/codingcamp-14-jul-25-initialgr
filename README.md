# Project: Vacatio Travel Landing Page

This repository contains the front-end code for "Vacatio," a modern and responsive travel landing page. It showcases various sections typical for a travel booking website, including a hero section, popular destinations, services offered, and an interactive booking form. This project is likely part of a coding camp module focusing on building dynamic and visually appealing web interfaces.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.) to view this project. No special server setup is required for basic viewing, as it's a static web application.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Revou-Coding-Camp/codingcamp-14-jul-25-initialgr.git](https://github.com/Revou-Coding-Camp/codingcamp-14-jul-25-initialgr.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd codingcamp-14-jul-25-initialgr
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer, or by dragging it into an open browser window.

    For a better development experience (e.g., live reloading), consider using a local development server like the "Live Server" extension for VS Code.

* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.

    * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.

    * **Custom CSS (`css/style.css`):** For specific styling, including background images and scrollbar hiding.

* **JavaScript (`js/script.js`):** For all interactive elements, dynamic content updates, form handling, and modal logic.

* **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons used throughout the interface.

## üí° Usage

Once the `index.html` file is open in your browser:

1.  **Welcome Modal:** Enter your name in the pop-up modal and click "Continue" to personalize the greeting.

2.  **Hero Section:** Use the search/filter bar to select a location, number of persons, and dates (note: these are currently static placeholders in the UI, but the form below is interactive). Click "Explore Trip" to navigate to the "Popular Destinations" section.

3.  **Popular Destinations:** Scroll horizontally through the destination cards using the navigation arrows or by dragging.

4.  **Booking Form:**
